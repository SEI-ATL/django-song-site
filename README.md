# Song Site
Here's a site that shows off an example of how to
create one-to-many associations and customize admin
interfaces in Django.

Run these commands to make sure you're got the proper database
set up, it has all of the most-recent migrations, and you've
created your own local super user.

```
createdb songsite
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
